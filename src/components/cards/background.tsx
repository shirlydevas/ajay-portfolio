        <p>Growing up in Bras√≠lia, the modernist architectural capital of Brazil, my home was a fusion of creativity and analytical thinking, influenced by my father's career as a photographer and my mother's profession as a lawyer. This unique blend has deeply shaped my perspective.</p>
        <p>My fascination with technology began at age four, sparked by our trusty beige computer. Although I pursued a degree in Computer Science, my true passion lies in the transformative power of great design craft, mainly inspired by the design craftsmanship behind Apple products.</p>
        <p>My curiosity led me to wonder: could I also create something that can evoke this effect on people?</p>
        <p>Today, I apply my multidisciplinary design skills, aiming to create solutions that make people feel and remember, elevating everyday experiences into inspiring solutions.</p>
